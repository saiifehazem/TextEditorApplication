It is also designed using separate compilation and divided into header file, cpp library file, and main cpp program file.

## **Installation**

  ### **Adding text to the file**
  
The user can add new text to the end of the file by choosing option 1 from the menu. The program opens the file in append mode, allowing the user to type in text until they press EOF character (Ctrl+z), which ends the writing and returns the user to the menu.

  ### **Displaying file content**
To display the content of the file, the user can choose option 2 from the menu. The program will display the current file content to the user and return them to the menu.

  ### **Emptying the file**
To empty the file, the user can choose option 3 from the menu. The program will clear the file and erase its content, returning to the main menu.

  ### **Encrypting and Decrypting file content**
Option 4 is used to encrypt the file content by re-writing the file content, shifted one ASCII character. Each character is replaced by the character following it in the ASCII table.

Option 5 is used to decrypt the file content by re-writing the original content from the encrypted file.

Merging another file
Option 6 allows the user to merge another file. The program will take the name of another file from the user. If this file does not exist, it will display a message "Invalid File Name." If the file exists, the program will add the given file to the end of the current file and return to the main menu.

  ### **Counting the number of words, characters and lines**
Option 7 is used to count the number of words in the file. A word is any sequence of characters not separated by white spaces (space, tab, new line, etc.).

Option 8 is used to count the number of characters in the file.

Option 9 is used to count the number of lines in the file.

  ### **Searching for a word**
Option 10 allows the user to search for a word in the file. The program will take a word from the user and print either "Word was not found in the file üôÅ" or "Word was found in the file üôÇ". The search is case-insensitive.

  ### **Counting the number of times a word exists in the file**
Option 11 is used to count the number of times a word exists in the file. The program will take a word from the user and print the number of times the word exists in the file as a separate word. The search is case-insensitive.

  ### **Changing the case of the file content**
Option 12, 13, and 14 are used to change the case of the file content. Option 12 turns the file content to uppercase, option 13 turns
